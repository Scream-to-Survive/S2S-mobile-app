# Scream to Survive system (s2s):


## Definition:

S2S system combines the use of smartphones, widely spread even in developing countries, and voice
recognition to help victims. Generally, a disaster victim is unable to access to his smartphone and ask help,
with this system, saying "help" will be enough to send automatically alerts to the nearest Emergency
Operation Services (EOS).

The essential feature of this system is the ability to analyze victims voices, words, sentences, etc, in order
to detect the emergency situation and immediately transmit victims GPS location, identification, etc.
In EOS side, after the first alert, the system save victim GPS coordinates and collect instantly all near users
locations (potential victims). It proceed to alert EOS staff, family contacts and eventually nearest
volunteers registered in the system.

Some of the basic objectives of S2S are:

- It automatically detects any disaster by using voice recognition algorithms.
- It responds in the time of critical situations by using real time system, right records are sent at
right time. Also, the other stakeholders are informed automatically by S2S and the alerts are
communicated through notifications, SMS, email etc.
- It responds to emergency situation with minimal human/manual intervention and interaction.
- It takes into account potential victims, by collecting all near users having S2S system on their
smart phones.

S2S system is composed of two parts:

###Mobile Application (Android or IOS smartphone) for citizens

This application collects voices, words or sentences said by the victim by using smartphone
microphone and converts them to text in order to deduce the emergency or risk situation and its
type (fire, earthquake, flood, etc) .
Then, the application sends an alert message containing victim information, his last location
and risk type to the emergency services (EOS).

### S2S for EOS

For EOS, we propose S2S part that allows officers and employees to receive alerts sending by
victims and select the appropriate action plan according to emergency type. They can consult
all medical and personnel information from database and send help to the exact location of the
victim.
The system collects all near users positions. This information will be very useful for victims
relief (earthquake for example).
Furthermore, the system sends victims location to nearest volunteers and family contacts to
increase surviving chance. The process is detailed in figure 2.
